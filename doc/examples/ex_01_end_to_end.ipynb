    "# End-to-end overview of wrfhydropy: Simulation evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this example is to show both the WRF-Hydro model API (application programming interface) and the ability of `wrfhydropy` to interact with model inputs and outputs: end-to-end capabilities all within python.  The vision of of `wrfhydropy` is to work seamlessly in python across the input, setup, run, and analysis phases of the model life cycle to support reproducible science without stifling the user. This example aims to illustrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model inputs receive little attention here but can easily be manipulated using the `xarray` library which provides the general strategy for working with model inputs and outputs in `wrfhydropy` (sometimes in conjunction with `pandas`). The evaluation and plotting of the output at the end of the example provide some flavor of using `xarray`. Particularly for users new to python, it is worth noting that the `xarray` approach is attractive because it provides a path to data export from python at every step. This allows users to choose points of departure from the confines of `wrfhydropy`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main focus of this example is the API, in particular the core objects which build a Simulation object: Model, Domain, Job, and optionally Scheduler. Building the Simulation object is key to understanding how to build the more complicated objects which contain it, to be covered separately: Ensembles, Cycles, and EnsembleCycles. The two main differences in `wrfhydropy` as compared to a shell-centered approach are the way it treats the concepts of \"namelists\" and \"jobs\". These are covered at length.\n",

    "## 2. Namelists and configurations in wrfhydropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the model repository and a model domain locally, we can get started with `wrfhydropy`. We go straight to the main structure or concept that `wrfhydropy` introduces and which users must understand: namelists. The `wrfhydropy` package introduces some complexity to the concept of the  namelists for the purposes of being able to easily swap domains while maintaining a certain \"model configuration\". Or vice-versa, one may also want to swap configurations while maintining a particular domain. The namelist approach in `wrfhydropy` supports this flexibility while also offering a mechanism for collecting sets of related namelists into a smaller set of files than would otherwise be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is a configuration known as the \"Analysis and Assimilation\" configuration of the National Water Model. For the purposes of a single execution of the model, a configuration is defined by: 1) compile-time options, 2) run-time options, in Fortran these are namelists (`hydro.namelist` and `namelist.hrldas`), and 3) input files (such as domain files defined at run-time or files implicit in the code such as tables). This begs the question: What is the \"Analysis and Assimilation\" configuration for a different domain? The parsing of namelist files by `wrfhydropy` provides an answer to the question: how do we maintain a \"configuraton\" on a different domain (and vice-versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us be clear that, in terms of the operational execution of the NWM, the state of the model is maintained by a set of process beyond running the model once with the 3 things comprising a configuraton above. Sepcifically, the model state is given in the analysis and forecast modes by \"cycling\" the model with ever changing forcing and observation files. Here we are not referring to the cycling workflow of the operational model. This is addressed in later examples. Here we confine our attention to serial (in time) execution of the model with fixed inputs, what we will term a \"simulation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle the notion of configuration across different domains, `wrfhydropy` separates the standard WRF-Hydro namelists in to two parts: model-side and domain-side namelists. Because WRF-Hydro begins with 2 namelist files, the result is 4 namelist files, as illustrated in the table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| WRF-Hydro namelist file |=| wrfhydropy model-side *example* file |+| wrfhydropy domain-side *example* file |+| config name\n",
    "|-------------------------|-|--------------------------------------|-|---------------------------------------|-|------------\n",
    "| namelist.hrldas         |=| hrldas_namelists.json                |+| hrldas_namelist_patches.json          |+| 'some_config'\n",
    "| hydro.namelist          |=| hrldas_namelists.json                |+| hydro_namelist_patches.json           |+| 'some_config'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The user presents `wrfhydropy` with the files in two right-hand columns and it creates the files in the left-hand columns, which is what the model requires at run time. The files in the left-hand column have specific names, which are hard-wired in the WRF-Hydro code. The JSON files supplied to `wrfhydropy` do not need specific names, the names here are the conventions we have used in `wrf_hydro_nwm_public` (model-side) and in the `croton_NY` domain (domain-side) which has been downloaded. The names of these files are presented to `wrfhydropy` at its run time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the files supplied to `wrfhydropy` potentially contain multiple named configurations in either or both of the respective model- and domain- sides of the namelists. To actually generate the namelist files needed by the model, `wrfhydropy` also needs a configuration name to pull the specific, desired namelists from the JSON files before combining the two sides of the namelists to present to the model. In this way, the JSON namelist files provide a way of saving multiple namelists (more importantly, diffs from a single base namelist in each) which may be a relevant collection for a given experiment or some other purpose. The collection of configurations in the specific JSON files used in this example are intended for the purposes of `wrf_hydro_nwm_public` model testing (they are not identical to the NWM operational configurations) and are used here for convenience rather than a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-side namelists\n",
    "As mentioned, for testing purposes we have created model-side namelists in `wrf_hydro_nwm_public`. We can examine those in our clone of the repository. Notice the names of all the available configurations in the file, starting with \"base\", from which the remaining configurations are differences:"

With `wrfhydropy` you can skip the non-reproducble interventions into the namelists in your run directory. Instead you can create and add multiple `Jobs` to your simulation before you run it. These jobs will run sequentially and, if you a `Scheduler` object, can be submitted to the queue as dependent jobs. This is shown below. Also shown below is how the provenance and artifacts related to the individual jobs are be stored in subdirectories of the simulation run directory with distinct job names.
